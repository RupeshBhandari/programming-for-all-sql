# Appendix B: Glossary of SQL Terms

In this appendix, you'll find a glossary of common SQL terms and their definitions, helping you understand and navigate the world of SQL databases.

## A

### ACID
- **Definition:** ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, which are the four properties that guarantee the reliability of database transactions.

## C

### Column
- **Definition:** A column, also known as a field or attribute, is a vertical entity in a database table that contains all the information associated with a specific data type.

### Constraint
- **Definition:** A constraint is a rule or condition enforced on a database to maintain data integrity, such as uniqueness, primary key, foreign key, and check constraints.

## D

### Database
- **Definition:** A database is an organized collection of structured data stored and managed in a computer system, typically managed by a database management system (DBMS).

### DDL (Data Definition Language)
- **Definition:** DDL is a subset of SQL used to define, modify, and remove the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)
- **Definition:** DML is a subset of SQL used to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from a database, typically through SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

## I

### Index
- **Definition:** An index is a data structure used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table by providing quick access to rows based on the values of specific columns.

## J

### Join
- **Definition:** A join is an SQL operation used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them, allowing users to retrieve related data from multiple tables in a single query.

## K

### Key
- **Definition:** A key is a column or set of columns in a database table used to uniquely identify each row, such as a primary key, unique key, or foreign key.

## Q

### Query
- **Definition:** A query is an SQL statement used to retrieve data from a database based on specified criteria, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

## R

### Relational Database
- **Definition:** A relational database is a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes data into tables with rows and columns, and establishes relationships between tables using keys.

## S

### Schema
- **Definition:** A schema is a collection of database objects, including tables, views, indexes, and constraints, that defines the structure and organization of a database.

## T

### Transaction
- **Definition:** A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements executed as a single unit of work, ensuring the consistency and integrity of database operations.

## V

### View
- **Definition:** A view is a virtual table generated by an SQL query that presents data from one or more tables in a predefined format, allowing users to retrieve and manipulate data without modifying the underlying tables.
