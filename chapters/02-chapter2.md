# Chapter 2: Database Design and Normalization

## Designing a Relational Database

### **The Relational Model**

The relational model is a way of organizing data in tables with rows and columns. It is based on the concept of a relation, which is a mathematical term for a set of values that have the same attributes.

The relational model works by creating tables that represent different types of data, and linking those tables together using keys. This allows you to query and manipulate the data in a flexible and efficient way.

The advantages of the relational model include flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. It allows you to easily add or remove data, and to perform complex queries on large datasets.

### **The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**

The ER model is a way of representing data as entities (objects) and their relationships to each other. It is often used in database design to model complex relationships between different types of data.

The ER model works by creating entities that represent different types of data, and linking those entities together using relationships. This allows you to model complex data structures in a clear and intuitive way.

The advantages of the ER model include its ability to model complex relationships between data, and its ability to represent data in a way that is easy to understand and modify.

### **Creating a Data Model**

A data model is a way of representing the structure and relationships of data in a database. It can take the form of a diagram or a written description, and is used to guide the design and development of the database.

You can create a data model by identifying the different types of data that you want to store, and mapping out the relationships between them. This can involve creating tables and columns, defining relationships between tables, and specifying data types and constraints.

Some best practices for creating a data model include using clear and consistent naming conventions, avoiding redundancy and duplication of data, and following normalization principles.

### **Defining Tables and Columns**

You can define tables and columns in a database by specifying the name of the table, the names and data types of the columns, and any constraints or rules that apply to the data.

Some best practices for defining tables and columns include using clear and concise names for tables and columns, choosing appropriate data types for each column, and defining constraints and rules that ensure data integrity.

### **Relationships between Tables**

Relationships between tables are connections or links between different tables in a database. They are used to model complex relationships between different types of data.

You can define relationships between tables by creating keys that link one table to another. This can involve creating primary keys and foreign keys that allow you to join tables together in meaningful ways.

Some best practices for defining relationships between tables include using clear and concise naming conventions for keys, avoiding circular or redundant relationships, and using appropriate data types for keys.

## Normalization

**What is normalization?**

Normalization is the process of organizing and structuring data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down a database into smaller, more manageable parts, and organizing those parts in a logical and efficient way. This involves identifying functional dependencies between data and ensuring that each piece of data is stored in only one place. The goal of normalization is to minimize data redundancy and data duplication, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors in the database. By eliminating these problems, normalization helps to improve the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data stored in the database.

**How does normalization work?**

Normalization works by breaking down a database into smaller, more manageable parts, and organizing those parts in a logical and efficient way. This involves identifying functional dependencies between data and ensuring that each piece of data is stored in only one place.

The benefits of normalization include improved data integrity, reduced redundancy and data duplication, and increased flexibility and scalability of the database.

There are several normal forms, including First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF). Each normal form represents a higher level of normalization and greater reduction of redundancy.

### **First Normal Form (1NF)**

First Normal Form (1NF) is the first level of normalization, which requires that all data in a table be *atomic and indivisible*. This means that each column in a table should contain only one piece of data, and that there should be no repeating groups of data.

To achieve 1NF, you need to break down any repeating groups of data into separate tables, and ensure that each column in a table contains only one piece of data.

The benefits of 1NF include improved data integrity, reduced redundancy and data duplication, and increased flexibility and scalability of the database.

### **Second Normal Form (2NF)**

Second Normal Form (2NF) is the second level of normalization, which requires that all non-key attributes in a table be functionally dependent on the primary key. This means that each column in a table should be related to the primary key in a meaningful way.

To achieve 2NF, you need to identify all the functional dependencies in a table, and break down any columns that are *not dependent on the primary key* into separate tables.

### **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

Third Normal Form (3NF) is the third level of normalization, which requires that all non-key attributes in a table be independent of each other. This means that each column in a table should be related to the primary key, and not to any other non-key attributes.

To achieve 3NF, you need to identify all the transitive dependencies in a table, and break down any columns that are dependent on other non-key attributes into separate tables.

The benefits of 3NF include improved data integrity, reduced redundancy and data duplication, and increased flexibility and scalability of the database.

### **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is a higher level of normalization that requires that all functional dependencies in a table be determined by the candidate keys. This means that each column in a table should be related to the candidate keys, and not to any other non-key attributes.

To achieve BCNF, you need to identify all the functional dependencies in a table, and ensure that they are determined by the candidate keys. This may involve breaking down the table into smaller tables that meet the BCNF requirements.

The benefits of BCNF include improved data integrity, reduced redundancy and data duplication, increased flexibility and scalability of the database, and faster query performance. By ensuring that all functional dependencies in a table are determined by the candidate keys, BCNF eliminates the possibility of update anomalies and other data inconsistencies that can occur in less normalized databases. This leads to more accurate and reliable data, which is essential for making informed business decisions. Additionally, BCNF can improve the performance of queries by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed, since each table contains only the data that is directly related to the candidate keys. This can lead to faster query times and a more efficient database overall.
