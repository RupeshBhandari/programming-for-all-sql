# Chapter 7: SQL Functions

## Mathematical Functions

SQL provides a wide range of mathematical functions that you can use in your queries. Here are a few examples:

- **`ABS()`** - Returns the absolute value of a number.
- **`ROUND()`** - Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
- **`CEIL()`** - Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.
- **`FLOOR()`** - Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number.
- **`POWER()`** - Returns the result of a number raised to a specified power.

## Date and Time Functions

SQL also provides several functions for working with dates and times. Here are a few examples:

- **`NOW()`** - Returns the current date and time.
- **`DATE()`** - Extracts the date part of a datetime value.
- **`TIME()`** - Extracts the time part of a datetime value.
- **`YEAR()`** - Extracts the year from a date value.
- **`MONTH()`** - Extracts the month from a date value.
- **`DAY()`** - Extracts the day of the month from a date value.

## String Functions

SQL also provides several functions for working with strings. Here are a few examples:

- **`LENGTH()`** - Returns the length of a string.
- **`SUBSTRING()`** - Returns a portion of a string.
- **`CONCAT()`** - Concatenates two or more strings.
- **`UPPER()`** - Converts a string to uppercase.
- **`LOWER()`** - Converts a string to lowercase.

## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on groups of rows. Here are a few examples:

- **`COUNT()`** - Counts the number of rows in a group.
- **`SUM()`** - Calculates the sum of a group of values.
- **`AVG()`** - Calculates the average of a group of values.
- **`MAX()`** - Returns the maximum value in a group.
- **`MIN()`** - Returns the minimum value in a group.
